      <h1>WHY</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>
        This website is part of an ongoing project that researches how sexual
        violence is visualized—specifically the stock photos and illustrations
        used in articles on the subject in national and regional newspapers,
        primarily in the Netherlands and Sweden. These images tend to fall into
        a limited set of recurring visual themes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A hand gripping a wrist</li>
        <li>The "stop" hand</li>
        <li>A groping hand</li>
        <li>A silenced mouth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Individually, these images might not be harmful. But when they become
        the only visuals that accompany stories about sexual violence, they
        begin to shape a narrow and problematic narrative.
      </p>

      <h2>WHY IS THAT A PROBLEM?</h2>
      <p>
        Writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie coined the term the danger of a single
        story. She describes how exposure to only one perspective—whether in
        books, media, or images—can distort our understanding and limit our
        empathy. As a child in Nigeria, Adichie only read stories about white
        children drinking ginger beer and talking about the weather. She assumed
        that was what books were supposed to be about. That’s the power of
        repetition—it defines what we think is normal, expected, or true.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to sexual violence, mainstream media typically tells a
        single story too. And it’s often from the perspective of the
        perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the images, the victim is nearly always shown—usually in a defensive
        pose—while the perpetrator is either absent or reduced to a shadowy
        hand. In some cases, the viewer is even placed in the perspective of the
        perpetrator. These depictions also subtly suggest that the victim had
        some agency to stop it: the raised hand, the act of resistance. But in
        reality, many survivors are frozen, shocked, or powerless to act.
      </p>
      <p>
        This narrow portrayal contributes to the myth of the "ideal
        victim"—someone who fights back, someone who fits a certain profile. It
        reinforces stereotypes that sexual assault only looks one way: the
        stranger in the bushes, the dramatic attack. But in reality, sexual
        assault is often far more ordinary and insidious:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a trusted friend</li>
        <li>a family member</li>
        <li>a partner</li>
        <li>catcalling</li>
        <li>unwanted touching in public</li>
        <li>coercion under the influence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And yes, sometimes it is the man in the bushes. It’s not one thing.</p>
      <p>
        To truly support survivors, we need to recognize and represent the full
        complexity of these experiences.
      </p>

      <h2>MAKING THE COMPLEXITY VISIBLE</h2>
      <p>
        I, Jonna Bo Lammers, believe that this narrative must change. The
        current visual language surrounding sexual violence is reductive and
        harmful.I believe illustration can offer something different. It has the
        power to depict not just actions, but emotions, internal states, and
        complexity—things traditional media images fail to capture.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this website, I aim to challenge the dominant imagery and offer a
        counter-visual story. One that does not flatten survivors’ experiences
        into clichés. One that offers empathy, nuance, and recognition. This is
        just the beginning—a visual pushback against the harm done by a single
        story!

      <h2>HOW DID THIS PROJECT START</h2>
      <p>
        I started this project because of something that happened to me on the
        metro in Stockholm. I was sitting in a four-seater, and a man across
        from me was intensely watching me. I was finishing up my Swedish
        homework, so I shoved my face back into my books. But every time I
        looked up, he was still staring. The last time I glanced up, I saw he
        was still fixated on me—and masturbating. A wave of adrenaline hit, and
        I immediately went into flight mode. I stood up, nearly dropped my
        books, and ran to the other end of the train. I vaguely looked back,
        hoping someone would intervene or say something—but I don’t think
        anything happened. I got off a stop early and ran to my Swedish class. I
        tried to talk to a friend from class about it, but our teacher
        interrupted and started the lesson. I pushed the whole thing to the back
        of my mind and tried to concentrate. I remember not being able to take
        the metro home afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next morning, I still couldn’t enter the metro. I felt the ghost of
        him sitting there. And yet, despite all the signs of trauma, I couldn’t
        acknowledge what had happened as sexual assault. I’ve experienced sexual
        assault before—I know how to recognize it, how to deal with it. So why
        didn’t I see this for what it was? After some time and good
        conversations, I realized: because he didn’t touch me, I thought it
        didn’t “count.” It didn’t feel “real.” Where did that idea come from?
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the same time, I was working on an illustration for a
        crowdfunding campaign for a documentary about the aftermath of sexual
        assault. As always, I researched how this topic has been visualised
        before—I like to understand the visual language that already exists. I
        looked at countless images accompanying articles about sexual assault in
        Dutch and Swedish media. Headlines like: “Study: 1 in 3 women has
        experienced sexual assault” or “Man assaults woman on the streets in
        Älvsjö.” And I started to notice patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        First: touch. It was everywhere. That explained my own response—I had
        internalized the idea that assault = physical touch. Second: the victim
        was almost always portrayed as a white woman, and the perpetrator as a
        white man.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, more subtle patterns emerged. The survivor is almost always
        shown—but not the assaulter. In many cases, the viewer is even placed in
        the point-of-view of the assaulter. Sometimes subtly, sometimes
        disturbingly explicitly. POV: you are assaulting someone. And there’s
        such an overwhelming emphasis on the act of saying no. This is deeply
        problematic. It implies that if you didn’t say no—maybe it wasn’t really
        assault. As if consent is only valid when verbally and forcefully
        stated. Sexual assault is already a topic riddled with guilt; these
        images only deepen that burden for survivors. More and more, I saw the
        same motifs repeated: the hand, the stop gesture, the shadowy threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, these images aren’t inherently bad. But their repetition
        creates a single narrative. One truth. And I’m missing so much
        colour—both figuratively and literally.
